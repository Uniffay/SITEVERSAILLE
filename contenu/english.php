If the first one existed long before the second one, very young, Louis XIV had a real passion for Versailles and decided to extend it well beyond the limits his father had set. The sovereign had a true vision for the site, becoming an architect and building the masterpiece of his life that will remain forever associated with it.
The future Louis XIV came to Versailles for the first time in October 1641, when his father Louis XIII sent him there with his brother to flee an epidemic of smallpox raging in the castle of Saint-Germain-en-Laye. It was not until 1651 that there was a real mention of the now king at Versailles. He took « the entertainment of the hunt », according to the Gazette de France of April 18, in the company of his governor. From that date on, the young sovereign returned there regularly each year in the company of his brother, his mother Anne of Austria and Cardinal Mazarin.");

The place remains a curiosity and Tsar Peter the Great will go there twice between May and June 1717. It was not until 15 June 1722 that the young Louis XV, at his request, returned to Versailles. His first concern was to complete the work of his great-grandfather but also to create more intimate and secluded spaces to complete his education.

The château will go through the war by mobilizing to support the national effort and to help the wounded and the families of soldiers as well as possible.
Versailles becomes again the place of all the attentions when the château is chosen for the signing of the peace treaty in 1919. Faced with the humiliation of the proclamation of the German Empire in the Hall of Mirrors in 1871, the Allies chose to organise the signing of the peace treaty in the same Hall.Despite this renewed attention, the castle was not spared the lack of maintenance that marked it for several years and the building suffered the ravages of time. Money is sorely lacking, and renovations are constantly being postponed.
In 1924, the billionaire and philanthropist John D. Rockefeller Jr. fell in love with this château, which had been damaged by the passage of time, and offered financial assistance to the French government for the restoration of the national heritage.");
